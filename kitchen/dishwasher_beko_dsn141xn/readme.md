# Dishwasher BEKO leaking water inlet valve

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `BEKO`    
Type: `DSN 141 XN`

## Description of failure
Over several days of non-use, water collects inside the dishwasher. 
This continues until the slightly open machine begins to leak.

## Failure investigation
The water comes out of the water inlet into the interior in a very small trickle. 
This could be due to the general water inlet valve, which no longer closes properly. 
This is removed and checked separately and found to be leaking. 
It probably no longer closes properly due to calcification. 
The valve is replaced and water no longer runs into the interior of the machine if it is not used for a longer period of time.
