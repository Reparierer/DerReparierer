# Hedgehog house

## Description of failure
In the many tidy gardens without hedges and mounds of leaves, hedgehogs can hardly find a safe shelter during the winter months.


## Failure investigation
To counteract this, we provide a hedgehog house. There are already some very good instructions for this online.

Inside, it is filled with leaves.

Please also note:
* The hedgehog house should be placed in a quiet and shady spot.
* The hedgehog house should remain in the garden all year round.
* Hedgehogs hibernate roughly from November to May.
