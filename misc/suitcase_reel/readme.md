# Suitcase

![](figures/overview.png)

## Description of failure
The wheels of a wheeled suitcase do not usually last long. After a few years, the rolling surface is worn down or falls off. As a result, the suitcase makes a very loud noise when you pull it.


## Repair
Fortunately, there are replacement rollers in the usual online stores where you can usually get everything. Replacement is quick and usually only requires a screwdriver as a tool. Unfortunately, only a few people are aware of this, most people buy a new case. 

After replacing the wheels, the suitcase rolls quietly through the streets again.
