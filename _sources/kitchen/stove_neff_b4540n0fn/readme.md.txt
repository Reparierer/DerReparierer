# Stove NEFF: Crazy behavior when adjusting the selector switch.
![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `Neff`     
Type: `B4540N0FN/03`

## Description of failure
If the selector switch is turned too quickly, the general behavior of the oven is strange. Incorrect programs are displayed, or when the oven has reached `190°C`, the temperature suddenly jumps back to `170°C`.

## Failure investigation
As the fault is mainly dependent on whether the switch is switched quickly or slowly, the cause of the fault is initially suspected to be the switch. As the contacts often corrode or burn over time, all contacts are cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. In the subsequent function test, problems continue to occur, but less frequently. This confirms the suspicion of the switch. This is replaced. After replacement, the oven works perfectly again!
