# Toaster Rowenta

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `Rowenta`


## Description of failure
When toasts are toasted, the holder does not stay down.

## Troubleshooting
When the lever is pushed down (to toast the toasts), a plastic tab closes the self-holding contacts of the lifting function. Current flows through the electric magnet holding the toasts in place. 

This is a very common problem with toasters. After a few years of use, the contacts are somewhat burned. Because of the higher resistance of the bad contact, the current flowing through the electromagnet is less than usual and not enough to hold the toasts in place. Cleaning the contacts with isopropyl alcohol solves the problem.
