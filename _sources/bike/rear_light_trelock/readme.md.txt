# Bike rear light

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `Trelock`     
Type: `LS 623`


## Description of failure
The rear light has a storage capacitor (also called supercapacitor) which ensures that the rear light on the bike remains illuminated when you stop. 

## Failure investigation
As the light continues to work, it is reasonable to assume that the supercapacitor is defective. First, the housing must be opened. This is explained very well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8oJ5WER-KY). The capacitor can then be replaced (`1 F`, `5.5 V`, `RM 20`). As the housing usually no longer closes tightly after opening, you should consider gluing it. 


Reichelt order number for the supercapacitor: `KO DCL5R5105HF`
