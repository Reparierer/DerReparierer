# Power Bank Ravpower loose connectors

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `Ravpower`      
Type: `Deluxe Series RP-PB19`     
Capacity: `16000 mAh / 59.2 Wh`

## Description of failure
The USB sockets on the power bank are loose and no longer supply any power.

## Failure investigation
When opening the Power Bank, it is immediately noticeable that the connectors have become detached from the solder joint due to the mechanical forces. 
Fortunately, the pads have not detached from the PCB. 
The sockets can therefore be desoldered, the pads freed from solder with desoldering wire and then the USB socket can be replaced and soldered on.
Note to disconnect the battery by desodering one wire before fixing the USB sockets.
