# Radio PHILIPS

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `PHILIPS`    
Type: `AZ382/12`


## Description of failure
One speaker fails sporadically.

## Failure investigation
If you touch the selector switch (CD - radio - USB), the sound comes or goes off. 

This is usually due to a defective switch or the solder connections. As the solder connections can be re-soldered without spare parts, this is tried first. In this case, the problem is solved and there is no longer a loose contact on the switch.

Note: When resoldering solder connections, remove the old solder first, then add new solder.
