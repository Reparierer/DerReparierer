# Headphone jack plug replacement

![](figures/overview.png)

## Description of failure
If the cable is shaken, the sound sometimes cuts out.

## Failure investigation 
By bending the cable at various points, the connector can be identified as the breaking point. 
To rule out a possible cable break near the plug, the cable is shortened by approx. `5 cm` and a new plug is soldered on.

Replacement part, e.g. `Neutrik Rean NYS 231 BG LL`
