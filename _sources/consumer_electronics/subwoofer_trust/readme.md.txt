Manufacturer: `Trust`

## Description of failure
When someone touches the volume control, sound sometimes disappears.

## Failure investigation
Due to the low frequency brass vibrations, the potentiometer has some broken solder connections. Resolder these, and the device works fine again!

Note: When resoldering solder connections, remove the old solder first, then add new solder.
