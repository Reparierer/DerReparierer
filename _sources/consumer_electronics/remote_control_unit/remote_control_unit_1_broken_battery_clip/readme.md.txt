# Remote control unit #1: Broken battery clip

![](figures/overview_1_labeled.png)

## Description of failure
It is not possible to turn on the remote device or control the remote device with the remote control.

## Troubleshooting
When opening the remote control, it is noticeable that one battery connector remains in the lid instead of being soldered to the circuit board like the other one. The battery clip is broken here. This can be easily repaired by soldering a short piece of cable.
