# Lamp

## Description of failure
Sometimes the lamp can be switched on, other times not. 

## Failure investigation
As the difficulties observed can be localized directly to the switch, it is measured directly. The connected switch has a resistance of `40 Ohm` ... `250 Ohm`, which is a multiple of a good resistance in the `mOhm` range.

After replacing the switch, the lamp can be used again without any problems.
