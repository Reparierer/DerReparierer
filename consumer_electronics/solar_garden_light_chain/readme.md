![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `Dehner Gardencenter`    
Item number: `2956829`



## Description of failure
#1: Only one LED is still working.     

#2: Furthermore, the battery is so weak that the lighting only lasts a few minutes after dark.

## Failure investigation
#1:  A broken cable is clearly visible. Solder it on, done.

#2: The contacts of the old battery are heavily corroded. As the lamp is used outdoors and renewed corrosion cannot be ruled out, a battery with a soldering tag is installed.
