# Remote control unit #2: Broken PCB

![](figures/overview_2.png)

## Description of failure
It is not possible to turn on the remote device or control the remote device with the remote control.

## Troubleshooting
This board is visually unremarkable at first. If you look into the infrared LED with a cell phone camera (not visible to the human eye, but only through the cell phone camera) and press a button, you won't see any reaction. Thus, there must be a problem somewhere. If you look more closely (hold the PCB against a light source), you can see a small hairline crack through the PCB. This separates the conductors to the transmitting infrared LED.

For the repair, the solder resist around the crack must be carefully removed with a knife. A fine piece of wire can then be soldered over the break. The remote control now works again!
