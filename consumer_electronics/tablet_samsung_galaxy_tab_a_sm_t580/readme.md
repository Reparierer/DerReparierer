Manufacturer: `Samsung`     
Type: `Galaxy Tab A, SM-T580`

## Description of failure
Does not charge. Screen flickers when the charging cable is plugged in, but the charging bar does not rise. 

## Failure investigation
A quick internet search shows that this is a [typical mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3uDwV5y9XM). The cable from the charging socket to the main board was apparently too short. Over the course of daily use, it can happen that this connecting cable slips out of the plug on the main board. In most cases, the cable has only slipped out half a millimeter. This is enough for the device to stop working.


The ribbon cable must be pushed back into the connector. It is also advisable to fix the ribbon cable with some sticky tape.

In many devices, the software is also frozen due to the poor plug connection. This can be solved by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery (reset). In this case, however, this was not enough as the battery was completely discharged. First of all, the device had to be charged (after the plug connection was reconnected as described). The screen shows frozen software, but the device charges. After an hour, the battery is sufficiently charged so that the reset (disconnecting and reconnecting the battery) can now be carried out.

The device is now working again!
