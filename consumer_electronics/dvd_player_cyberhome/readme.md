Cyberhome CH-DVD 452

## Description of failure
The device does not work at all. Display stays empty.

## Troubleshooting
![power_supply_capacitors](figures/power_supply_capacitors.png)

When measuring the output voltage of the power PCB, this voltage is not stable. An investigation into the electrolytic capacitors shows a bad impedance behavior. Replacing the capacitors solves the issue. 



## Investigation in the electrolytic capacitors
Both broken capacitors, the `1000 µF` and the `2200 µF` device are analyzed by an impedance analyzator (full line `red` and `blue`). The dash-doted lines shows the calculated waveform of healty capacitors.
