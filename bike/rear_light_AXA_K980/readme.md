# AXA Bike Rear Light

![](figures/overview.png)

Manufacturer: `AXA`     
Type: `K980`    

## Description of failure
The rear light has a storage capacitor (also called supercapacitor) which ensures that the rear light on the bike remains illuminated when you stop. 

## Failure investigation
As the light continues to work, it is reasonable to assume that the supercapacitor is defective.
The capacitor can then be replaced (`1 F`, `5.5 V`, `RM 20`). 
As the housing usually no longer closes tightly after opening, you should consider gluing it. 


Reichelt order number for the supercapacitor: `KO DCL5R5105HF`       
(Note: The replacement component is a big bigger than the original one. 
But bending the contacts a little bit, works fine.)
